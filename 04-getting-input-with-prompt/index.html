  <h1>JS Atomic 04 - Getting Input With Prompt</h1>

  <h2> What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
  <p>A.</p>

  <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
  <p>The value is set to an empty string.</p>

  <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
  <p>I chose my variable names logically. If I have a list of my variable names to someone who hasn't seen my code, they should be able to reasonably predict what information I might store in each.</p>

  <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
  <p>If I completely changed the question or the order of the questions, it would make sense to change the variable names as well.</p>

  <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
  <p>Most websites use html forms to collect information. Using prompt() could be useful if for some reason the website requires information from the user before viewing the page, but is generally regarded as a relic from the 90's. HTML forms are better-looking and less obnoxious.</p>

  <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
  <p>Short of constructing your own using DOM methods and Input elements: No.</p>


  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>None.</p>
