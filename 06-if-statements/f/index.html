    <h1>JS Atomic 06f - Triangles</h1>

    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
    <p>Prediction: NaN will be output to the console. The return will be invalid triangle.</p>
    <p>Actual: NaN was output to the console as predicted, and the alert returned the invalid triangle message.</p>

    <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
    <p>Prediction: The program will run as normal. The alert will return invalid triangle.</p>
    <p>Actual: Program runs as normal, and the alert returns invalid triangle as expected.</p>

    <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
    <p>Prediction: The program will run as normal, even though negative numbers should not be allowed.</p>
    <p>Actual: As predicted, though none of the numbers I tried returned a valid triangle.</p>
