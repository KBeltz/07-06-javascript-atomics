    <h1>JS Atomic 06e - Driver's Ed, Part 2</h1>

    <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
    <p>Yes, it matters. For part 1, the input could return multiple values so all of them were returned regardless of the order. For this one, it stops once it reaches the first true statement, so if they are out of order the wrong output could be returned.</p>

    <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
    <p>That doesn't even make sense. A number can't simultaneously be less than 16 and greater than 21. Nothing would return true because nothing IS true in this statement.</p>

    <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>It is easier to have the numbers visually, but if I had to replace them with variables I would probably use consecutive letters like a-e or something like that.</p>
