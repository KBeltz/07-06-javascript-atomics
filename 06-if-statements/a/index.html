  <h1>JS Atomic 06a - Relational and Equality Operators</h1>

  <h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
  <p>Boolean.</p>

  <h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
  <p>They have the same value, but one is a boolean and the other is a string, therefore they cannot be used in the same way.</p>
