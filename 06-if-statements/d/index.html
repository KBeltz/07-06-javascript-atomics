    <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
    <p>It doesn't appear so. </p>

    <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
    <p>I used && because that is the only logical choice. The || doesn't even make sense in my brain for that. It would be wrong.</p>

    <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
    <p>Non-numeric values return NaN. Yes, it is important to check for NaN values. I haven't found a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements.</p>

    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p>None.</p>
