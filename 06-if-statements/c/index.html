    <h1>JS Atomic 06c - Guess a Number</h1>

    <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
    <p>Either will work. There are some cases where === will be better, such as when the stored number is 0, and no input is entered, == will return "Correct!" when it should not.</p>

    <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
    <p>Either will work. It seems like === would be best, because == has the potential to accept some input that it probably shouldn't.</p>

    <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
    <p>The == will compare values regardless of type. The === will check for equality of value AND type.</p>

    <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)</h2>
    <p>Leaving it as a string is easier, and reduces the potential for developer error; however, converting the input to an integer would make it easier to do math to it in the future if that were ever necessary. </p>
