##Javascript - Atomic Assessments

We use Javascript to determine dynamic behavior for our sites and to manipulate the DOM. Javascript is a fully-featured programming language; our focuses are domain-specific, but you can use Javascript to do almost anything any other programming language can do.

For all of these atomic assessments, you'll be provided (at least some) HTML, a concrete task, and often a Javascript starter.

In terms of best ways to practice, the more practice you can get, the better. There are quite a few atomics here, and for many of them, I've included some ideas for extension exercises.

Place all of these atomics in a Git repository (pushed to GitHub) called (for example) 07-06-javascript-atomics, each in their own well-named folder within that repository (e.g. intro-to-js). In this way, this set of atomics (which will have you go through many of the most common tasks) will act as a reference for you later.

Solutions are provided for some of the first batch of exercises.
