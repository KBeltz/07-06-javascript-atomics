  <h1>JS Atomic 05 - Basic Math</h1>

  <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
  <p>Output is "NaN" for combinations of numbers and letters. Incoming string needs to be converted to an integer to be parsed correctly, using parseInt().</p>

  <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
  <p>Console output says nothing. Alert window output is "NaN" as before.</p>

  <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
  <p>Loops.</p>

  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>A.</p>
