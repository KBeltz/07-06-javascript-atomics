    <h1>JS Atomic 08a - What's the Password?</h1>

    <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
    <p>I don't understand what this question is asking. My code is in the global.js file. I used a while loop because my for loop wasn't working. I tried it both ways.</p>

    <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>I used ===, but either should work since the input is being taken as a string.</p>
